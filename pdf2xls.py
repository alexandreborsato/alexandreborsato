#Sure, here's a Python script that uses the PyPDF2 and openpyxl libraries to read a PDF file and convert its contents into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet:

#```python
import PyPDF2
import openpyxl

# Open the PDF file
file_path = "/Users/borsatoa/Desktop/AB/Actual/lab/03/ItauProventos.pdf"
pdf_file = open(file_path, 'rb')

# Create a PDF reader object
pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_file)

# Create a new Excel workbook
workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()
worksheet = workbook.active

# Iterate through each page of the PDF
row = 1
for page_num in range(len(pdf_reader.pages)):
    page = pdf_reader.pages[page_num]
    text = page.extract_text()
    lines = text.split('\n')

    # Write each line to a new row in the Excel sheet
    for line in lines:
        worksheet.cell(row=row, column=1, value=line)
        row += 1

# Save the Excel workbook
output_path = "/Users/borsatoa/Desktop/output.xlsx"
workbook.save(output_path)

# Close the PDF file
pdf_file.close()

print(f"PDF contents have been converted and saved to {output_path}")
```

Here's how the script works:

1. The script imports the necessary libraries: `PyPDF2` for reading the PDF file, and `openpyxl` for creating and writing to the Excel spreadsheet.
2. The file path of the PDF file is specified in the `file_path` variable.
3. The PDF file is opened in binary mode using `open(file_path, 'rb')`.
4. A `PdfReader` object is created from the opened PDF file using `PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_file)`.
5. A new Excel workbook is created using `openpyxl.Workbook()`, and the active worksheet is obtained using `workbook.active`.
6. The script iterates through each page of the PDF using a `for` loop and the `len(pdf_reader.pages)` function.
7. For each page, the text content is extracted using `page.extract_text()`, and the text is split into lines using `text.split('\n')`.
8. Each line is written to a new row in the Excel worksheet using `worksheet.cell(row=row, column=1, value=line)`, and the `row` counter is incremented.
9. After all pages have been processed, the Excel workbook is saved to the specified output path (`/Users/borsatoa/Desktop/output.xlsx`) using `workbook.save(output_path)`.
10. The PDF file is closed using `pdf_file.close()`.
11. A message is printed to indicate that the PDF contents have been converted and saved to the specified output path.

Note that this script assumes you have the PyPDF2 and openpyxl libraries installed. If not, you can install them using pip:

```
pip install PyPDF2 openpyxl
```

Also, make sure to replace the file paths (`file_path` and `output_path`) with the appropriate paths for your system.
